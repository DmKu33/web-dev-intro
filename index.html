    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><strong>Name:</strong> Dmytro</p>
    <p><strong>Year:</strong> Senior</p>
    <p><strong>Major:</strong> Computer Science</p>

    <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
    <p>I want to learn frontend technologies better. I've always avoided web design and used templates instead. Before graduating, I want to understand the complete tech stack and fill this knowledge gap.</p>

    <h2>My Experience</h2>
    <p><strong>Web:</strong> Mostly backend work, some Figma, D3.js, and editing React code</p>
    <p><strong>Programming:</strong> I do AI/ML research on compound AI systems - combining different AI models with classical approaches. This needs diverse programming skills across software and hardware.</p>

    <h2>Tutorial Summary: Displays</h2>
    <p>The Displays tutorial covers monitor and screen concepts including resolutions, aspect ratios, and video formats. Mostly it focused on frame rates, progressive versus interlaced scanning (1080p vs 1080i), and resolution standards (from Game Boy to 8K). Where, progressive scan displays all lines sequentially while interlaced alternates between odd/even lines for bandwidth efficiency. The tutorial also explains aspect ratios like 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10 across different devices. Additionally, it covers Action Safe (90% screen area) and Title Safe (80% area) concepts for broadcast content design.</p>

    <h2>Web Projects I Like</h2>
    
    <h3>1. It is as if you were doing work</h3>
    <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://pippinbarr.com/itisasifyouweredoingwork/">https://pippinbarr.com/itisasifyouweredoingwork/</a></p>
    <p>This simulates a "corporate slave" workflow with draggable windows and fake work tasks. It's a showcase of web capabilities that partially recreates a desktop OS entirely in a browser.</p>

    <h3>2. 100,000 Stars</h3>
    <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/">https://stars.chromeexperiments.com/</a></p>
    <p>Interactive space visualization that lets you zoom from galaxy level to solar systems. Great storytelling with smooth interactions that show the power of web-based data visualization.</p>

    <h3>3. NVG8.io</h3>
    <p><strong>Link:</strong> <a href="https://nvg8.io/">https://nvg8.io/</a></p>
    <p>Not from the Critical Web Design Index, but this dynamic website has the type of animations I want to learn. It shows modern web development techniques I'd love to explore.</p>
